# metricTester 1.0.3

* Added mean root distance (MRD) and mean distance to the most recent common ancestor of a sample (distMRCA). For MRD, added both presence-absence and abundance-weighted forms, and for distMRCA, added ability to calculate both the distance to the overall MRCA of a sample, and the distance to the average of the pairwise MRCAs.

# metricTester 1.0.2

* Added more informative error message for instances where the specified simulation parameters yield community data matrices with insufficient individuals/species.

# metricTester 1.0.1

* Added code to run all parallel functions sequentially by default. User must now explicitly invoke parallel processing, to avoid issues on Windows machines.

# metricTester 1.0.0

* This is the first submission of metricTester to CRAN. No other news to report.

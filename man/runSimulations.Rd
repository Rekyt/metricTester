\title{Run defined spatial simulations}
\usage{
runSimulations(simulations.input, simulations = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulations.input}{A prepared simulations.input object, as generated by
prepSimulations.}

\item{simulations}{Untested. It should be possible to provided a list of named
spatial simulations here, rather than needing to define them in defineSimulations.}
}
\value{
A list of lists of simulation results, where each of the first-order elements
in the list relates to a unique simulation as defined in defineSimulations.
}
\description{
Given a prepared simulations.input object, will run all simulations defined in
defineSimulations, and return a list of randomized CDMs.
}
\details{
Currently we are running 3 spatial simulations. This function
first confirms that the input is of class simulations.input and, if so, then
confirms that the simulations are in a named list (via checkSimulations),
then lapplies all spatial simulation functions to the input object.

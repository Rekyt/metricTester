\title{Calculate alpha or beta metrics across a set of parameters, with varying tree sizes}
\usage{
varyTreeSize(alpha = TRUE, tree.sizes, richness.vector, delta, abundances,
  beta.iterations, iterations, cores)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Whether to calculate alpha or beta phylogenetic community structure
metrics. Default is TRUE. Set to FALSE for beta metrics.}

\item{tree.sizes}{List of numbers of species desired in each total tree. If
provided as a vector of numbers, will be coerced to a list.}

\item{richness.vector}{Number of species to be placed in each quadrat. See details.}

\item{delta}{A value for the delta transformation (Pagel 1999). Values greater than 1
push the branching events towards the root, while values less than 1 push the branching
events closer to the tips. See details for particularly low delta values.}

\item{abundances}{A vector of abundances. See examples.}

\item{beta.iterations}{Because the type of beta-level phylogenetic community structure
metrics used here return a single value per community data matrix, it is not possible
to look for inter-metric correlations with only a single matrix and tree. To deal with
this, the same tree can be used with different community data matrices. This argument
specifies the number of matrices to be used per tree. Not needed if alpha=TRUE.}

\item{iterations}{How many times to simulate the given set of parameters. For instance,
with a single tree size, richness.vector, delta, and two sets of abundances, and 10
iterations, the result will be a list with 10 elements. Each of those 10 elements will
be a list of two elements, each of which will be the calculated metrics for a given
set of parameters (one for each abundance vector).}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to be used for parallel processing. The iteration aspect
of the function is parallelized, so for efficiency purposes, it is best to run this
over numerous iterations rather than repeating the same parameter numerous times (e.g.,
rather than setting deltas to rep(1, 10), set delta to 1 and iterations to 10).}
}
\value{
A list of lists of data frames.
}
\description{
Takes a specified tree shape, community richness, and a vector of abundances, and
takes a set of tree sizes, and calculates the community structure metrics.
}
\details{
If given a small value, e.g. 0.1, the delta parameter
(tree shape) can occasionally result in oddly formatted trees that would cause errors.
To deal with this, there is an internal check that will recreate a new tree and
re-scale it with the desired delta. This has not been tested at delta < 0.1, and is
currently programmed with a while loop. Care should be taken not to get R stuck in an
indefinite loop at delta values even lower than 0.1

\examples{
system.time(vSize <- varyTreeSize(alpha=T, tree.sizes=c(59, 100),
	richness.vector=40:59, delta=1,
	abundances=round(rlnorm(5000, meanlog=2, sdlog=1)) + 1, iterations=2, cores=1))

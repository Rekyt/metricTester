\usage{
distMRCA(samp, tree, pairwise)
}
\arguments{
\item{samp}{A picante-style community data matrix with sites as rows, and
species as columns.}

\item{tree}{An ape-style phylogeny.}

\item{pairwise}{}
}
\value{
A vector of distMRCA values.

\description{
Given a picante-style community data matrix (sites are rows, species are columns), 
and a phylogeny, calculate the distances of sets of taxa to their MRCA.
}
\details{
Experimental metrics! This function calculates two simple but potentially
useful measures. The first, accessed by setting pairwise to FALSE,
is the mean branch length between a set of taxa and their most recent common ancestor
(MRCA). I have not seen this used in the literature before, but it seems likely I'm
wrong. This metric was not tested in our recent Ecography review, but given
certain data structures, it seems potentially useful. In other cases, the MRCA will
often simply be the root of the tree, and the metric will perhaps be of less use. 
Large values of the version of distMRCA correspond to taxa with a
distant MRCA, while small values correspond to taxa with a more recent MRCA.
Given an ultrametric tree, the mean distance
between a set of taxa and a single ancestor is of course equal to the distance between
one of those taxa and the ancestor. However, in case an ultrametric tree is passed
to the function, I do define it as the mean distance between all present taxa
and their MRCA. It will throw a warning if a non-ultrametric tree is passed along. The
second measure calculated by this function is accessed by setting pairwise to TRUE.
Here, per plot, the metric finds the distance of the MRCA of each pairwise taxon
comparison from the root. The value returned per plot is then the mean of these
distances. In contrast to the first flavor of this metric, large values of this metric
correspond to plots where the taxa present are more recently derived, while small
values correspond to plots where the taxa are less recently derived (average common
ancestor closer to the root). To make these measures more comparable, it may be better
subtract the final values from the total tree height (with caveat about ultrametric
tree above). It would also be easy to derive an abundance weighted version of this
function.

#simulate tree with birth-death process

sim.abundances <- round(rlnorm(5000, meanlog=2, sdlog=1)) + 1

metricTester is a package containing functions written by Eliot Miller, Chris Trisos and Damien Farine. Many of these functions are detailed in our paper reviewing phylogenetic community structure and null models here: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.02070/abstract. Other functions (those related to phylogenetic and trait fields) are explained in our paper on honeyeater ecomorphology here: http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/14/034389. The URL to the version of metricTester released in conjunction with our Ecography paper is: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/21050/eliotmiller/metricTester
